Hey, I'm Addie and this is my github website. üéâ

I'm doing this for my Advanced Computer Science project. 

You should come to Dexter. It a private school in Wichita Falls, TX, and it's pretty cool. Some examples are when we had a DJ at school on just a regular Friday, when we got to pie teachers in the face, how we're painting all the walls for an art project, or how we held a robotics competition.

Another pretty cool thing is one of the students from Dexter in our computer science class that I'm doing this project for won the Hack-a-thon so congratulations to Eldon! üëèüèº

You should also come see Alice in Wonderland.
WFBT, the ballet company I am in, is performing it as a ballet in May.
It will be ‚ú®VERY‚ú® cool. There will be some pretty extreme special effects.
There are also different styles of dance.
